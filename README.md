# Gladius Slicer

**In-Progress** Slicer for FDM 3D printing written in Rust with a focus on customization and modularity.

**Questions?** Please use the github discussion page.

**Want to contribute?** Open a PR. See contributing document for more information.

Gladius Slicer is currently in a alpha state and very little is stable so assume any new release will cause breaking bugs. If you need something stable, please open an issue or discussion, so we can plan out the interface. 

# Usage

This project is a command line application. A GUI is planned but not my expertise. A seperate project will be created when a GUI is started.

```
USAGE:
    gladius_slicer.exe [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <INPUT>...

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information
    -v               Sets the level of verbosity

OPTIONS:
    -o <OUTPUT>          Sets the output file to use
    -s <SETTINGS>        Sets the settings file to use

ARGS:
    <INPUT>...    Sets the input file to use


```

### Input file examples:
* ` "{\"Auto\":\"test_3D_models\\3DBenchy.stl\"}" ` : Automatically Centers 3DBenchy file in center of the build area
* ` "{\"AutoTranslate\":[\"test_3D_models\\3DBenchy.stl\",-10,0]}" `  : Automatically centers 3DBenchy file in center of the build area offset -10 mm off center in the x dimension.
* ` "{\"AutoTranslate\":[\"test_3D_models\\3DBenchy.stl\",0,-80]} " "{\"AutoTranslate\":[\"test_3D_models\\3DBenchy.stl\",0,80]} " `: print 2 3DBenchy's 
* ` "{\"Raw\":[\"test_3D_models\\3DBenchy.stl\",[[1.0,0.0,0.0,124.0],[0.0,1.0,0.0,105.0],[0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0],[0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0]] }" `:3DBenchy with given transform matrix

### Settings file example
Settings files are hJSON, a human readable json that supports comments. Examples can be found in the settings folder.

# Current Status

 Generated GCode has been used for multiple prints (Benchy, xyz calibration cube,marvin) with a Prusa Mk3 and gives similar results to other slicers. 

### Finished
* Perimeters
* Solid infill (Linear) and Partial Infill (Linear, Rectilinear,Trianlge, and Cubic)
* Brim and skirt support
* Roof and Floors
* Fan Control
* Speed Control
* Acceleration control
* Temperature Control
* Combinable/Chainable Settings Files
* STL File format
* Layer slow down for small layers
* Change settings based on layer
* Elephant foot compensation
* Many other feature ( see settings file for more information)

### In Progress
* 3MF file format
  * Fails with multi-drive zip files ( like what is generated by microsoft 3D Builder)
* Time Calculations
  * They are not very accurate, underestimates the time currently
* Plugins/Mods
  * Traits have been started but no loading yet.
* Arc Optimization
  * Started but buggy and not active
* Code Documentation
  * Some code is documented
* Useful Error Messages
  * Errors often aren't graceful
* Support Generation
  * Supports can be generated but they are poor
* Lightning Infill
  * Added and is functional but being watched for errors

### Coming Shortly

* Perimeter start options
* Percentage Complete Gcode
* Octoprint integration
* Retraction Wipe
* GUI

### Eventually
* Multiple Extruder Support


### Supported Printers
* I only own a Prusa Mk3
* Friend owns a CR10
* Other printer can easily be added
